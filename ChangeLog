Version 1.8.0
-------------
    * Puku sync will now add `go_replace_directive` labels to any go_repo targets with a replace directive in the go.mod file (#114)

Version 1.7.2
------------
    * evaluating binary expressions correctly for srcs. (#109)

Version 1.7.1
------------
    * resolve deps for go_repo to subrepo targets rather than its install
      (#108)

Version 1.7.0
------------
    * Allow the user to specify output format when outputting to stdout on
      lint, sync, migrate and licences update.

Version 1.6.2
------------
    * Fix bug where we weren't recursively looking at base configs to
      determine if we should stop for a directory (#104)

Version 1.6.1
------------
    * Don't set visibility on deps of experimental labels (#101)

Version 1.6.0
------------
    * Known kinds can now specify a srcsArg which tells puku which arg on the
      build rule go srcs should be added to.

Version 1.5.1
------------
    * Sync: if we encounter a replace directive where the old path and new
      path are the same don't delete the target as we can just update the
      version.

Version 1.5.0
------------
    * Migrate: Avoid duplicating `go_repo()` targets when migrating a module where
      we already have a `go_repo()` target for whatever reason (#93)
    * Migrate: When migrating a `go_module()` that depends on other `go_module()`
      targets, just migrate those modules as well, rather than trying to set `deps`
      on `go_repo()`. The `deps` approach didn't work as well as hoped, and is not
      recommended. (#94)

Version 1.4.1
------------
    * Don't sync go.mod on save

Version 1.4.0
------------
    * Migrate now inserts rules in the same place as the rules it's replacing (#90)
    * Sync now works with multiple third party folders, only sycing modules to the
      main third party build file (#89)

Version 1.3.3
------------
    * Fix check for detecting if we're using go_module (#87)

Version 1.3.2
------------
    * Keep the existing expressions from attribute lists where possible to avoid noise
      and keep comments (#85)

Version 1.3.1
------------
    * Treat paths passed as labels (e.g. `//foo/bar`) as relative to the repo root (#83)

Version 1.3.0
------------
    * Allow paths passed to puku to be absolute (#82)
    * Allow passing in a file instead of a dir. Puku will format the directory it's in. (#82)
    * Fix issue where all paths were being considered wildcards (#82)
    * Use the config of the target package when resolving dependencies for a target (#81)

Version 1.2.1
------------
    * Log a warning instead of exiting when failing to set visibility on a target (#78)
    * Add "C" as a known import (#77)

Version 1.2.0
------------
    * Fix issue where puku would add a subinclude to third_party/go/BUILD
      erroneously (#74)
    * Allow users to disable the built in kinds (#69)
    * Follow require/provides logic when evaluating targets (#72)
    * Sanitise paths passed to puku fixing issues with stack overflows
      loading config (#75)
    * Limit lint fixes (e.g. list re-ordering etc.) to paths passed to puku (#71)

Version 1.1.1
------------
    * Remove replace directive so `go install github.com/please-build/puku` works as
      expected

Version 1.1.0
------------
    * Parse the whole third party tree to find go_module rules (#56)
    * Added a `licences` subcommand that can be used to update licences (#51)
    * Allow `migrate` to accept modules as positional args to migrate piecemeal (#50)

Version 1.0.0
------------
    * Support for `go_benchmark` (#41)
    * Make `puku watch` write to file rather than stdout (#42)
    * Added `puku migrate` to convert `go_module` targets to `go_repo` (#44, #48)

Version 0.2.0
------------
    * Fixed some issues around resolving install lists on `go_repo` and `go_module` (#33)
    * Implemented default visibility. This will be parsed out of `package()` statements
      in BUILD files automatically, but rules can be configured to assume a certain
      visibility. This can be useful for rules like `go_repo` that default to PUBLIC.

Version 0.1.0
------------
    * Initial release
