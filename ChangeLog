Version 1.0.0
------------
    * Parse the whole third party tree to find go_module rules (#56)
    * Added a `licences` subcommand that can be used to update licences (#51)
    * Allow `migrate` to accept modules as positional args to migrate piecemeal (#50)

Version 1.0.0
------------
    * Support for `go_benchmark` (#41)
    * Make `puku watch` write to file rather than stdout (#42)
    * Added `puku migrate` to convert `go_module` targets to `go_repo` (#44, #48)

Version 0.2.0
------------
    * Fixed some issues around resolving install lists on `go_repo` and `go_module` (#33)
    * Implemented default visibility. This will be parsed out of `package()` statements
      in BUILD files automatically, but rules can be configured to assume a certain
      visibility. This can be useful for rules like `go_repo` that default to PUBLIC.
